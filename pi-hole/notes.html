<h4>Application Data</h4>
<p>The container is pre-configured to store persistent data for Pi-Hole under <code>/srv/appdata/pihole</code>. You may
    change the location by expanding <em>Show advanced options</em> below, then look under <em>Volume mapping</em>.</p>
<p>To create the application data folder:</p>
<pre>
mkdir -p /srv/appdata
chown $USER /srv/appdata
</pre>
<h4>Timezone</h4>
<p>It is recommended to set the timezone variable according to your geographic location. See <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List" target="_blank">this wiki page</a> for
    possible values.</p>
<h4>Network Configuration</h4>
<h5>⬩ Recommended mode: <code>host</code></h5>
<p>It is recommended to set the network of this container to <code>host</code>. By default, <strong>pi-hole</strong>
    will use port 53 to listen for DNS requests, and ports 80/443 for the admin website. If you want to use different
    ports when running in <code>host</code> network mode, change the respective environment variables below.</p>
<p><strong>Web Server Port(s) Format</strong></p>
<p>The value should be a comma-separated list of ports to listen
    on. It is possible to specify an IP address to
    bind to. In this case, an IP address and a colon must be prepended to the port number. For example, to bind to
    the loopback interface on port 80 (IPv4) and to all interfaces port 8080 (IPv4), use <code>127.0.0.1:80,8080</code>.
    <code>[::]:80</code> can be used to listen to IPv6 connections to port 80. IPv6 addresses of network interfaces can
    be
    specified as well, e.g. <code>[::1]:80</code> for the IPv6 loopback interface. [::]:80 will bind to port 80 IPv6
    only.</p>
<p>In order to use port 80 for all interfaces, both IPv4 and IPv6, use either the configuration <code>80,[::]:80</code>
    (create one socket for IPv4 and one for IPv6 only), or <code>+80</code> (create one socket for both, IPv4 and IPv6).
    The
    '+' notation to use IPv4 and IPv6 will only work if no network interface is specified. Depending on your
    operating system version and IPv6 network environment, some configurations might not work as expected, so you
    have to test to find the configuration most suitable for your needs. In case <code>+80</code> does not work for your
    environment, you need to use <code>80,[::]:80</code>.<br />
    If the port is TLS/SSL, a letter 's' (secure) must be appended, for example, <code>80,443s</code> will open port 80
    and
    port 443, and connections on port 443 will be encrypted. For non-encrypted ports, it is allowed to append letter
    'r' (as in redirect). Redirected ports will redirect all their traffic to the first configured SSL port. For
    example, if webserver.port is <code>80r,443s</code>, then all HTTP traffic coming at port 80 will be redirected to
    HTTPS
    port 443.</p>
<p>When specifying 'o' (optional) behind a port, inability to use this port is not considered an error. For
    instance, specifying <code>80o,8080o</code> will allow the webserver to listen on either 80, 8080, both or even none
    of the
    two ports. This flag may be combined with 'r' and 's' like <code>80or,443os,8080,4443s</code> (80 redirecting to SSL
    if
    available, 443 encrypted if available, 8080 mandatory and unencrypted, 4443 mandatory and encrypted).</p>
<p>If this value is not set (empty string), the web server will not be started and, hence, the API will not be
    available.
</p>
<h5>⬩ Alternative mode: <code>bridge</code></h5>
<p>It is possible to run <strong>pi-hole</strong> in <code>bridge</code> network mode instead. The downside is that all
    connected clients may appears to have the IP of the bridge network gateway (e.g. <code>172.17.0.1</code>). This does
    not affect the ad-blocking functionality of the DNS server, but the admin website dashboards may not be as useful
    for investigation purposes.</p>
<p>When running in <code>bridge</code> network mode, make sure to add mappings for the following container ports:</p>
<pre>
+----------------+--------------------+----------+
| Container Port | Purpose            | Optional |
+----------------+--------------------+----------+
| 53/tcp, 53/udp | DNS ports          | no       |
| 80/tcp         | Admin site (HTTP)  | yes      |
| 443/tcp        | Admin site (HTTPS) | yes      |
+----------------+--------------------+----------+
