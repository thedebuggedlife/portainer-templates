<h4>Network Configuration</h4>
<p>If your pi-hole container is running in <strong>host</strong> network mode, it is recommended to also set this
    container to run in <strong>host</strong> network mode. You will need to make sure that the port used to expose the
    metrics (9617 by default) is not already in use by the host.</p>
